# image-color-palette-generator

Hello there, Welcome to my repository!

My name is Matthew Adrianus Mulyono, and this is my Color Palette Generator Website

This project is taken from 100 Days of Python Course on Udemy on Day 91 Portofolio Project section

This is simply a Flask Website that generates a color pallette out of an uploaded image consisting of 10 most common colours from the image.

Thanks for visiting this repo! Have a nice day!!
